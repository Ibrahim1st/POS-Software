# POS-Software
A Point of Sale (POS) application is used to process sales transactions in retail or hospitality environments.
Here's a basic example of a POS application in Java:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class POSApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        double totalAmount = 0.0;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the POS Application!");

        while (true) {
            System.out.print("Enter the item name (or type 'done' to finish): ");
            String itemName = scanner.nextLine();

            if (itemName.equalsIgnoreCase("done")) {
                break;
            }

            System.out.print("Enter the item price: ");
            double itemPrice = scanner.nextDouble();

            System.out.print("Enter the quantity: ");
            int quantity = scanner.nextInt();
            scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline character

            double itemTotal = itemPrice * quantity;
            totalAmount += itemTotal;

            System.out.println("Added: " + itemName + " (Quantity: " + quantity + ")");
            System.out.println("Item Total: $" + itemTotal);
        }

        System.out.println("-------------------------------");
        System.out.println("Total Amount: $" + totalAmount);
        System.out.println("Thank you for using the POS Application!");
    }
}


We import java.util.Scanner to handle user input.

We create a class POSApp which contains the main method, the entry point of the application.

Inside the main method, we initialize a Scanner object to read user input from the console.

We initialize a totalAmount variable to keep track of the total amount of the transaction.

We display a welcome message to the user.

We enter a while loop that continues until the user types "done". Inside the loop:

We prompt the user to enter the name, price, and quantity of each item.
We calculate the total cost of each item and add it to the totalAmount.
We display the details of the item added and its total cost.
After the loop ends (when the user types "done"), we display the total amount of the transaction and a thank you message.

This code provides a basic framework for a POS application where users can input items, their prices, and quantities, and the application calculates the total amount of the transaction. Depending on your requirements, you may need to add features like payment processing, inventory management, user authentication, etc.
